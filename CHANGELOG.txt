2.12
  * We've now pinned and cached ALL versions of the Gems required.
  * The timeout for the Console has been set to 1 million seconds.
  * Added back the vagrant user and VirtualBox / VMWare extensions.
2.11
  * All of the Forge modules have been updated in the cache - this means the Fundamentals capstone will work offline.
  * We’ve removed the http://rubygems.org source from the /root/.gemrc file so that all gem installs are local. (We’ve also pinned versions of rspec and serverspec so they will work.) 
  * The extraction of the PE tarball shouldn’t be interruptible.
  * Moved to a metadata.json file instead of Modulefile.
  * All of the metadata for modules is correct so `puppet module install` pulls in the right dependencies when you are online.
  * Updated the RPMs we need for offline Practitioner. (Thanks for your help on this Gabe!)
  * Set the timeout on the console to 27 hours so you should only have to log in twice.
  * We got rid of the allow_virtual warning for `puppet agent` runs!
  * I've fixed the VirtualBox duplicate MAC address (again).
  * I've fixed VirtualBox still thinking it was attached to my DVD drive.
  * A bunch of small, incremental changes.
2.6
  * Added version numbers to the filename
