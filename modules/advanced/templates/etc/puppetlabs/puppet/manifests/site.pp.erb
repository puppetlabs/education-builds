## site.pp ##

# This file (/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/manifests/site.pp) is the main entry point
# used when an agent connects to a master and asks for an updated configuration.
#
# Global objects like filebuckets and resource defaults should go in this file,
# as should the default node definition. (The default node can be omitted
# if you use the console and don't define any other nodes in site.pp. See
# http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/language_guide.html#nodes for more on
# node definitions.)

## Active Configurations ##

# PRIMARY FILEBUCKET
# This configures puppet agent and puppet inspect to back up file contents when
# they run. The Puppet Enterprise console needs this to display file contents
# and differences.

# Define filebucket 'main':
filebucket { 'main':
  server => 'classroom.puppetlabs.vm',
  path   => false,
}

# Make filebucket 'main' the default backup location for all File resources:
File { backup => 'main' }

# DEFAULT NODE
# Node definitions in this file are merged with node data from the console. See
# http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/language_guide.html#nodes for more on
# node definitions.

# The default node definition matches any node lacking a more specific node
# definition. If there are no other nodes in this file, classes declared here
# will be included in every node's catalog, *in addition* to any classes
# specified in the console for that node.

node default {
  # We are managing this here as it will work with --server but not cause
  # errors when the student does a run against themselves as they share a
  # ENC. Further this is better the default group as its cron entry would not
  # work to get this classified on the first run. Deal with it.
